# A scalable and maintainable front-end architecture

Modern front-end frameworks and libraries make it easy to create reusable UI 
components. This is a step in a good direction to create maintainable front-end 
applications. Yet, in many projects over the years we have found that making 
reusable components is often not enough. Our projects become unmaintainable, as 
requirements changed or new requirements came up. It took longer and longer to 
find the correct file or debug something across many files.

Change needed to happen. We often are not the only one working on the front-end. 
So, we need to the setup of our front-end projects. We need to make them 
maintainable and scalable. This means that we can apply changes in the current 
features, but also add new features quicker.

This basic structure aims to address a number of these areas.
